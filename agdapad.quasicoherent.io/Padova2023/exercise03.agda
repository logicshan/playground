----[ GENERALITIES ON EQUALITY ]----
------------------------------------

-- EXERCISE: Fill in this hole, thereby proving that equality is a "congruence";
-- by this lemma, we can apply the same operation to the two sides of an equation
-- and still be sure that the equation holds.
cong : {A B : Set} {x y : A} → (f : A → B) → x ≡ y → f x ≡ f y
cong f p = {!!}

-- EXERCISE: Prove that equality is symmetric.
symm : {A : Set} {x y : A} → x ≡ y → y ≡ x
symm p = {!!}

-- EXERCISE: Fill in this hole, thereby proving that equality is transitive.
trans : {A : Set} {x y z : A} → x ≡ y → y ≡ z → x ≡ z
trans p q = {!!}

-- EXERCISE: Prove that equal functions have equal values. (The
-- converse is a principle known as "function extensionality" which
-- can be postulated in Agda but is not assumed by default.)
equal→pwequal : {A B : Set} {f g : A → B} {x : A} → f ≡ g → f x ≡ g x
equal→pwequal p = {!!}

-- EXERCISE: Think about the expression "(⊥ ≡ ℕ)". Is it well-defined?
-- What would be its meaning?
